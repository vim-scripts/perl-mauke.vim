This file is based on the perl.vim syntax definition that comes with vim, but with some heavy modifications intended to improve vim's perl highlighting.

The list of changes includes:
* 'new' and 'croak' are not keywords and no longer highlighted as such
* Special highlighting for pragmas (e.g. "use warnings") now applies to all pragmas coming with perl
* Fixed number highlighting ("0X" is not a valid hex prefix, "L" is not a valid suffix)
* Fixed escape sequence highlighting ("\X123" is not a hex escape, "\123" is limited to three octal digits)
* Lots of improvements in the matching of quoted constructs:
  - vim no longer thinks "!" is a quoting operator (so "!!" works right)
  - support for arbitrary quoting delimiters (e.g. "m%...%" works)
  - I've also tried to make nesting work (e.g. "s[foo[bar]][b[a]z]g")
* Full support for subroutine definitions (parsing of prototypes and attributes)
* Recognizes v-strings and statement labels
* "=>" quotes its LHS, even if it's a keyword
* Perl 5.10 support: new keywords ('given', 'when', 'default', 'state', 'break') and regexp control operators ('PRUNE', 'SKIP', 'COMMIT', etc.)
